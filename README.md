# 🌊 Rising Waters: A Machine Learning Approach to Flood Prediction

## 📌 Overview
**Rising Waters** is a machine learning–based project designed to predict the likelihood of floods using historical and environmental data.  
The goal of this project is to support early warning systems and help reduce the impact of floods by enabling timely decision-making.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze historical flood and environmental data  
- Build a machine learning model to predict flood occurrence  
- Evaluate model performance using standard metrics  
- Provide a scalable and data-driven flood prediction approach

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach
The project follows a standard ML pipeline:

1. **Data Collection** – Historical weather, rainfall, river level, and flood records  
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Cleaning, normalization, and feature selection  
3. **Model Training** – Training ML algorithms on prepared datasets  
4. **Model Evaluation** – Accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix  
5. **Prediction** – Predicting flood risk based on new input data
